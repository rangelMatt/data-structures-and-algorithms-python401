# Linked List Insertions
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write the following methods for the linked list class:

append :
    - Arguments: Value
    - Adds a new node with the given `value` to the end of the list

insert before:
    - Arguments: Value, new value
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

insert after:
    - Arguments: Value, new value
    - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

O(1), because it is insertion, BUT getting to the middle of node is O(n)
