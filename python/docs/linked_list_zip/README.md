# Linked List Zip
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a function called zip lists

Arguments:
    - 2 linked lists

Return:
    - New Linked List, zipped as noted below
    - Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the zipped list.
    - Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
    - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Whiteboard Process

![linked-list-zip](linked_list_zip.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big O:

Time: O(n) 1 operation for length of linked list

Space: O(1) Constant space, only temporary variables are being used

Failing last test. Not sure what to do about that, yet.
